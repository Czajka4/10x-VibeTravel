## Project Description

VibeTravels is a web application designed to help amateur tourists plan their trips efficiently. The main functionality allows users to create notes about attractions and places they want to visit, then organize them into coherent trip plans. The application leverages artificial intelligence to analyze notes and generate suggestions that optimize users' travel experiences.

### Key Features

- Create and manage trips with personalized information
- Add notes with details about attractions, dates, and prices
- Organize notes in chronological order
- Generate AI-powered suggestions for plan improvements
- Export trip plans in simple formats (markdown/JSON)
- Calculate estimated trip budgets based on note entries

### Problem Statement

Amateur tourists often struggle with effective trip planning between locations, leading to wasted valuable time during their trips. They may lack sufficient knowledge about places they want to visit, resulting in inefficient travel plans.

Specific problems addressed by VibeTravels:
- Difficulty in determining the optimal order of visiting attractions
- Lack of awareness about opening hours, closure days, or other attraction restrictions
- Difficulty in estimating total trip costs
- Absence of tools for organizing and storing information about planned trips
